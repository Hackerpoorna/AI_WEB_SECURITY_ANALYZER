## **üîπ Project Overview**
**AI Web Security Analyzer** is an advanced security assessment tool designed to scan and analyze websites for vulnerabilities. This tool leverages **AI-driven techniques** to enhance web security assessments and provides professional-grade insights into potential threats.

## **üîπ Features & AI-Powered Elements**
**AI-Powered Analysis** - Uses machine learning models to classify potential phishing websites and predict security risks.  
**Hacker-Themed UI** - Dark/Light mode with a **terminal-style** hacking console.  
**Automated Vulnerability Detection** - Runs **Nmap & SQLMap** scans with AI-enhanced reporting.  
**Smart Framework Detection** - Uses **AI & pattern analysis** to detect web technologies (WordPress, Django, Laravel, etc.).  
**AI-Based Threat Score** - Predicts website risk levels based on attack patterns.  
**Professional Report Generation** - Saves results in a structured format for further analysis.

## **üîπ Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Flask, Scikit-learn, Requests, BeautifulSoup, OS, Subprocess)
- **Nmap** (Port scanning & security analysis)
- **SQLMap** (Automated SQL Injection detection)
- **AI & Machine Learning** (Threat classification, framework detection, risk assessment)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (For a hacker-themed professional UI)
